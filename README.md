# CostaWebSite
 This is a website i'm currently developing for a bar called Costa do Castelo in Le√ßa Palmeira, which belongs to my family.
I started this project because i knew my family bar didn't have a website yet but i also didn't have the skills to do it yet, 
so now was the perfect oportunity for me to step up to a real life scenario, helping them spread the digital view of the bar, while at 
the same time improving my portfolio and my web dev skills.
